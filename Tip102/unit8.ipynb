    "## Problem 7: Remove Plant\n",
    "A plant in your houseplant collection has become infested with aphids, and unfortunately you need to throw it out. Given the root of a BST collection where each node represents a plant in your collection, and a plant name, remove the plant node with value name from the collection. Return the root of the modified collection. Plants are organized alphabetically in the tree by value.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the node with name has two children in the tree, replace it with its inorder predecessor (rightmost node in its left subtree). You do not need to maintain a balanced tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pseudocode has been provided for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the time complexity of your function. Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time complexity. Assume the input tree is balanced when calculating time complexity."
