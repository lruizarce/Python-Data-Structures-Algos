    "## Problem 1: Selective DNA Deletion\n",
    "As a biologist, you are working on editing a long strand of DNA represented as a linked list of nucleotides. Each nucleotide in the sequence is represented as a node in the linked list, where each node contains a character ('A', 'T', 'C', 'G') representing the nucleotide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the head of the linked list dna_strand and two integers m and n, write a function edit_dna_sequence() that simulates the selective deletion of nucleotides in a DNA sequence. You will: - Start at the beginning of the DNA strand. - Retain the first m nucleotides from the current position. - Remove the next n nucleotides from the sequence. - Repeat the process until the end of the DNA strand is reached.\n",
