What is the need for Complexity Analysis?
    a. Which approach is better?
        - Which approx uses less time and less memory
    b. Why care about identifying which approach is better?
        - Huge amount of data which means a significant change in performance when thinking about the optimal solution. 
    c. What does better mean?
        - faster and uses less memory
What is Time Complexity Analysis?
    a. Measure time on different machines with different hardware. 
    b. Count the number of simple operations the computer has to do.
    c. How runtime grows as input size grows.
